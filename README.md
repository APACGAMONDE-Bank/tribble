# tribble

Tribble is a collection of computer graphics project built with three.js,
a user-friendly toolkit for WebGL. The project took off after I completed
[Udacity's Interactive 3D Graphics](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs291) course.
There are many neat concepts that I want to learn, and Tribble is the place
where I share my journey.

## Assets
The angular application, stylesheets, and navigation scripts should go
in the `app/` directory. Any three.js related projects, plugins, and shaders should
go in the `projects/` directory. Angular templates should go inside `templates/`.
Lastly all third-party libraries should go inside `vendor/`.
