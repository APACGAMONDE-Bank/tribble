            When starting a three.js project, all you'll see is a black screen.
            This gird serves a guide for new projects. Bundled with the Orbit Controls plugin,
            which allows you to move and zoom the camera with a mouse.

            One fundamental concept of Computer Graphics is understand how all geometries are
            represented as triangles. 3D meshes are simply composed of 2D triangles. By
            using many triangles, a mesh will appear smoother and more realistic
            at the cost of performance.

            My first independent Computer Graphics project. I learned about different lighting,
            meshes, and geometries. I also created a custom triangular prism geometry for the roof.
            You'll definitely want to outline your work with paper and pencil first.

            Particles are different from traditional triangular-based geometries.
            They are rendered as particle systems where all the particles are
            treated as a single mesh. Particles are awesome!

            Chase cam is a concept that is very common in video games.
            Basically the user moves an entity and the camera follows the entity
            from its point of view. Move around with the WASD keys.

            For this project, I started exploring the simplest animation technique&mdash;rotation.
            The blades of the windwill were created using custom geometries. Overall, the windmill
            was created as an <em>Object3D</em>. I also applied a <em>Shader</em> for the first time to create a
            dotted-like appearance.

            <em>BrightnessShader</em>, and <em>WaterShader</em> to achieve its realistic effect
            while maintaining performance with the GPU. The swaying ocean tide effect
            was created with a water <em>Normal Map</em>.

            Explored the interpolation-based animation technique called <em>Tweening</em>.
            Tweening is the process of interpolating and generating intermediate key frames
            in between the starting and ending frames. Recreated from Lesson 10 of Udacity's
            <em>Interactive 3D Graphics</em> course.
